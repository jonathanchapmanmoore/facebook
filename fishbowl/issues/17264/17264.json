The newsfeed and friend bar bouth support panning gestures using touch.\r\n\r\nOnce I'm able to move the codebase over to .Net 4 I also will be able to switch to the Surface Toolkit for some of these, to make the touch experience _much_ better.\r\n\r\nWhich areas in particular are you interested in seeing better touch support?",
