    "Description": "why there are so many unnamed side links? If I click on them they seem to be loading forever:\nhttp://j.mp/rtCfAp\nAnd for me 'Groups' link remain in the forever loading state as well when notes, photos etc. links works:\nhttp://j.mp/v8vkzn\nÂ \nDespite those bugs I want to request a new feature:\nIt would be better if I could configure those unnamed side links to point any person's profile, any favorite group or pages, so that I could quickly browse them.",
