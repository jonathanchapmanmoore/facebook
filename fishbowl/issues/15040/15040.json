Currently I parse the URL enough to notice that it's a link to a user that we can display within the app.  I don't parse the query part to see if it's related to a post that we are displaying.  If we're able to we should scroll it into view and ensure all comments are visible.  I'm not sure that the URL has enough public information to do this.",
