    "Description": "I'm currently coalescing multiple types of notifications, e.g. app notifications and friend requests.  The UI lets you mark any of these as read, but I don't respect the read tag for friend requests.  We need to keep a local copy of notifications that have been read that I can't tell the server to not send me again.",
